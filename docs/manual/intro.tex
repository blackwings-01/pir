\section{Introduction}
This document is meant a technical specification of the Delite Hardware
Definition Language, or DHDL. DHDL is a domain-specific language designed to
serve as a low-level compiler intermediate representation (IR) to generate efficient
hardware accelerators. DHDL is embedded in Scala, so a DHDL program is really a Scala
program with a few special imports. An application written in DHDL describes a \emph{hierarchical data flow
graph} which consists of many kinds of \emph{nodes}. The graph can be used for further
analysis or low-level code generation.

DHDL is a research project under active development, so this document will frequently get obsolete.
Every effort will be made to keep the contents of this document consistent with the actual
implementation, but the author makes no guarantees.
